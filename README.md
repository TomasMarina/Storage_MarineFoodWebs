# Marine food web repository
This is a repository with the aim of storing complex and highly-resolved marine food webs. The food webs can be downloaded from 'multiweb' R package: https://github.com/lsaravia/multiweb

Most of these food webs were analysed for the folowing research we published in PlosOne in 2018:
"Architecture of marine food webs: To be or not be a â€˜small-world", https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198217
